Epidemiological models are mathematical represnations of the spread and dynamics of disease within populations. 
These models help researchers and public health officials understand and predict how diseases may spread, assess the impact of interventions, and make informed decisions to control and manage outbreaks. There are several types of epideniolocal models, and they can be broadly
categorized into compartmental and induvidual-based models.

## SIR Model(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered)
# SEIR Model(Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered)
## SIRS Model(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible
